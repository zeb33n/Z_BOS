# Z_BOS
A small 32bit operating system, written to learn.

## Running The Project
At the moment only qemu is supported through building from source using a cross compiler. If you are on fedora you can run the `buildcrosscompiler.sh` to build your own. Other wise please follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler). Once you have a cross compiler built you can run the project using `make`.
